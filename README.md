# Tic Tac Toe Game - React Native

A simple **Tic Tac Toe** game built with **React Native**. This game showcases how to build a classic game using React Native, **Zustand** for state management, and an efficient algorithm to determine the winner of the game. 

## Features
- **Centralized State Management** using **Zustand** for cleaner, more maintainable code.
- Efficient **Winner Algorithm** that finds the winner without iterating through the entire grid, focusing only on possible winning conditions.
- **Responsive UI** for a smooth experience across different screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Grid Size**: Users can change the grid size to 3x3, 4x4, 9x9, or other custom sizes for more varied gameplay.

## Technologies Used
- **React Native**: For building the mobile application.
- **Zustand**: For centralized state management.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic and rendering.

## Algorithm Highlights
- Instead of iterating through the entire grid to check for a winner, the algorithm focuses on the most likely winning conditions. This makes the process more efficient and reduces unnecessary iterations.
